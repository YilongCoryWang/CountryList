# Country List

This project shows country list with react.

## Assumptions

1. Minimal screen width: 375px (iphone SE)
2. Maximal screen width: 1920px
3. Clients use the latest browsers (Chrome, Edge)
4. Google MAP API key is not exposed
5. Client screen width is fixed when viewing map page

## How to run

Project relies on .env file which contains API info. I understand that in real production environment, this file is not part of the git repo. But for making the project easier to run, this file is still included in the repo.

In the project directory, you can run:


### `1. Clone the repo`
```shell
git clone git@github.com:YilongCoryWang/CountryList.git
```

### `2. Pull the dev branch`
```shell
git pull origin country_list_dev
```

### `3. Install dependencies`
```shell
npm install
```

### `4. Start project`
```shell
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `5. Run tests`
```shell
npm test
```
